different between document and window object

The document and window objects are both part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web page. While they are related and interact with each other, there are some key differences between them:

1. Window Object:
   - The window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is displayed.
   - It serves as the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment, providing access to various properties, methods, and events.
   - It represents the top-level browsing context and holds information about the window's dimensions, location, history, and other browser-related features.
   - It can be used to open, close, or manipulate browser windows or tabs.
   - It also provides access to other objects like the document, navigator, location, and more.

2. Document Object:
   - The document object represents the web page or HTML document that is loaded in the browser window or tab.
   - It is a property of the window object, accessible as `window.document` or simply `document`.
   - It provides access to the HTML elements, such as elements, attributes, styles, and content within the document.
   - It allows manipulation of the document's structure, content, and presentation using methods like `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, etc.
   - It exposes properties and methods for interacting with forms, handling events, and modifying the page's appearance and behavior.

In summary, the window object represents the browser window or tab, while the document object represents the loaded web page or HTML document within that window. The window object provides access to the document object and other browser-related features, while the document object provides methods and properties for manipulating the document's structure and content.
